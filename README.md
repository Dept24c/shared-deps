# shared-deps

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/walmartlabs/shared-deps/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/walmartlabs/shared-deps)

If you've worked with projects with *large* numbers of subprojects
(using the [lein-sub](https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-sub) plugin),
you may have noticed that coordinating your dependencies can get a bit
cumbersome.  On one of our main projects, we have 70 sub-projects.
Upgrading to the latest release of, say, core.async, involves too
much global search and replace ... it is not *Don't Repeat Yourself*.

With this plugin, you can define *sets* of dependencies,
and store them across all-sub modules in a single `dependencies.edn` file
at the root of your project.

Each sub-module must include the shared-deps plugin, and specify
a :dependency-sets key, a list of dependency set ids.

`dependencies.edn` contains a single map: from dependency set id
to a vector of dependencies for that dependency set.

More than just coordinating artifact versions
is the challenge of maintaining the nest of exclusion rules
that can occur when trying to mix and match various third party
dependencies and their individual transitive dependencies.
Having a DRY solution here keeps the `project.clj` files very concise
and readable.

## Example

Your `dependencies.edn` file contains the following:

```clojure
{:clojure [[org.clojure/clojure "1.7.0"]]
 :core.async [org.clojure/core.async "0.2.371"]]
 :speclj [[speclj "3.3.1"]]
 :cljs [[org.clojure/clojurescript "1.7.170"]]}
```

Each dependency set can define any number of dependencies, including
:exclusions or other options. These dependencies are simply
appended to the standard list of dependencies provided
in `project.clj`.
 
A sub-project may define dependencies on some or all of these:
 
 ```clojure
(defproject my-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/core.match "0.2.2"]]
  :dependency-sets [:clojure
                    :core.async]
  :profiles {:dev {:dependency-sets [:speclj]}})                   
```

The extra dependencies are available to the REPL, tests, or other plugins, exactly
as if specified directly in `project.clj` traditionally.

## Extending Sets

Say you notice that *everywhere* that you use ClojureScript (the :cljs dependency set)
you are also using the :core.async dependency set.  That can be expressed
by changing `dependencies.edn`:

```clojure
{:clojure [[org.clojure/clojure "1.7.0"]]
 :core.async [[org.clojure/core.async "0.2.371"]]
 :speclj [[speclj "3.3.1"]]
 :cljs {:extends [:core.async]
        :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojurescript "1.7.170"]]}}
```

At this point, if you specify the :cljs dependency set in a sub-project, 
you get not just the :cljs artifact dependencies, but the :core.async
artifact dependencies 'for free'. 

The shared-deps plugin
treats the :cljs dependency set as a dependency of the :core.async dependency set; this means that
the :core.async artifact dependencies will be added first, and 
the :cljs artifact dependencies added later.

## Leveraging Sets

You shouldn't think of a set as a way of just specifying a single dependency;
you will likely find cases, as above with :cljs and :core.async, where you
consistently use several artifacts together. 

We regularly have complex dependency sets with ids like :logging, :testing,
or :database.

## Sibling Dependencies

Project quite often contain modules that are dependencies to other modules
within the same umbrella project.

In addition to the dependencies in the dependencies.edn file, the share-deps
plugin builds a map of all sibling projects, keyed on the project name symbol.

This is helpful as it is always up to date with the version number, also defined
in each sibling module's `project.clj`.

This works by reading the umbrella project's `project.clj`, and reading the
:subs key (which is primarily used by the lein-sub plugin), then reading
each sibling module's `project.clj`.

Be aware that your `dependencies.edn` file may also have symbol keys, and
those will override any automatically generated sibling dependencies.

## Usage

Put `[walmartlabs/shared-deps "0.2.2"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your `project.clj`.

This must be done in *each* sub-module, and must *not* be in the top-level module
(the one that has the `lein-sub` plugin).

You can verify the behavior with  `lein pprint :dependencies`; the output from
this command will be the full list of dependencies, after the shared-deps plugin
has processed all dependency sets in the active profiles.  You will need
to enable the lein-pprint plugin.

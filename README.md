# shared-deps

If you've worked with projects with *large* numbers of subprojects,
you may have noticed that coordinating your dependencies can get a bit
cumbersome.  On one of our main projects, we have 70 sub-projects.
Upgrading to the latest release of, say, core.async, involves too
much global replacing ... it is not *Don't Repeat Yourself*.

With this plugin, you can define *categories* of dependencies,
and store them across all-sub modules in a single `dependencies.edn` file
at the root of your project.

Each sub-module can include the `shared-deps` plugin, and specify
a :dependency-categories key, a list of categories.

`dependencies.edn` contains a single map: from category
to a vector of dependencies for that category.

## Example

Your `dependencies.edn` file contains the following:

    {:core.async {:dependencies [[org.clojure/core.async "0.2.371"]]}
     :speclj [[speclj "3.3.1"]]
     :cljs [[org.clojure/clojurescript "1.7.170"]]}
 
Why is :core.async specified as a map, and the other categories as vectors?
The map value, with a :dependencies key, is the verbose option
(that will eventually support some additional features; see below).
Internally, a vector is wrapped as a map.

Each category can define any number of dependencies, including
:exclusions or other options. These dependencies are simply
appended to the standard list of dependencies provided
in `project.clj`.
 
A sub-project may define dependencies on some or all of these:
 
    (defproject my-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
      :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.7.0"]
                     [org.clojure/core.match "0.2.2"]]
      :dependency-categories [:core.async]
      :profiles {:dev {:dependency-categories [:speclj]}})                   

The extra dependencies are available to the REPL, tests, or other plugins, exactly
as if specified directly in the `project.clj` normally.

## Coming Soon

Categories will be able to extend other categories.

Categories will be able to provide exclusion rules.

## Usage

Put `[shared-deps "<version>"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your `project.clj`.
